Bidding System was created with Python

GET STARTED:
1. If you do not have Python installed in your machine, please install it
2. Open a terminal inside the project folder, and run:
	python server.py
3. Once server is up, it will wait for 4 clients to connect

4. You will need to open 4 additional terminals on the same project folder
5. Run the below command in all 4 terminals in order to get all the clients to join
	python client.py
6. The bid will start once all 4 clients are joined
7. You can find the highest price that the client is willing to bid for an item inside the .txt files

The program will run until all of the item listed are bid form it will then display which client has won what item, and which item has not been earned
